# arduino-onboard-led-control-with-serial-connection
Hi,

In this C# project, i have try to connect arduino to send and recevie data via serialport. 
This code light up the led which is connected to the 13 pin on the arduino board.
This code can send and receive data on Arduino UNO. But at the more specific type of Arduino boards  
(like Leonardo)just sends data. It doesn't read data from board. When i solve that problem, i will publish it too.

Thanks for your attention.
